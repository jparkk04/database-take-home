    # 1. Increase the success rate of queries
    # 2. Minimize the path length for successful queries

    # You have access to:
    # - initial_graph: The current graph structure

    # - Each query's target node

    # - max_total_edges: Maximum number of edges in the graph
    # - max_edges_per_node: Maximum edges per node
    # - All nodes must remain in the graph
    # - Edge weights must be positive and â‰¤ 10
